<p>&ldquo;Program objective: Advance, integrate, and demonstrate new privacy research from math, statistics, and computer science to make it possible and practical to link and analyze multiple datasets of personal information while rigorously protecting privacy.</p>
<p>One of the great quandaries of the information age is that personal information is the most valuable data for addressing societal problems and simultaneously the most dangerous data for individual privacy. Data can show us how to better educate our children, avoid the diseases that loom ahead for millions, reduce crime and incarceration, improve public services, and much more. But the tradeoff between gaining the value of data and protecting privacy seems immutable today, and that limits access to rich educational, health, and administrative datasets.</p>
<p>The deep value in data lies in multiple datasets that are owned and protected by different agencies and companies. In a handful of instances today, organizations are addressing this issue with protected data enclaves. An enclave carefully pools and curates datasets and makes them available to a closely vetted set of researchers. The approach requires each data contributor to trust every other participant, including every data contributor, every researcher in the enclave, and the enclave operators. So the scale and reach is ultimately limited.</p>
<p>A next-generation capability for data and privacy is now becoming possible. New technologies and methods to derive the value of data while rigorously protecting privacy are emerging from research in math, statistics, and computer science. They are starting to be used in some instances, typically for narrow applications. But they still require a high level of specific technical expertise and are not sufficiently proven to open up practices for data and privacy. Actuate’s program aims to demonstrate a powerful, practical, and scalable advanced capability by building on this nascent work.</p>
<p>Building on emerging research in secure computation and differential privacy, Actuate’s program will develop and demonstrate an end-to-end system for managing and analyzing data while adhering to the privacy requirements of the data’s owners. The result will be an open-source architecture in which (1) individuals and organizations can exercise agency over their data, easily specifying how and when it can be used; (2) datasets from multiple sources can be analyzed together without having to establish mutual agreement or trust among their owners; and (3) researchers can perform analyses across these datasets that yield powerful new insights with minimal disruption to their current analytical processes – all while preserving privacy.</p>
<p>Actuate’s program will bring together expert privacy researchers, prototype open-source systems developers, a wide range of demonstration projects, red teams to probe vulnerabilities, and evaluations. The system’s new capabilities will be demonstrated on a series of data analysis applications to assess the improvements in data utility, data protection, and computational overhead that are achievable.</p>
<p>In parallel, the program will engage with respected neutral agencies and private organizations that can set standards and establish certification processes for privacy protection of sensitive data. New legislation, regulations, and policies can then refer to these standards, and data owners and data users can use certified processes in confidence. The program’s open-source platform could then make possible a vibrant marketplace where data owners and data users negotiate the exchange of data for research, policy, business, and other applications, without friction and without privacy exposure.&rdquo;</p>
